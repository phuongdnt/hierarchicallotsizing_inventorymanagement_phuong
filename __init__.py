"""Top-level package for inventory_management_RL_Lot.

This file makes the ``inventory_management_RL_Lot`` directory a
Python package.  Without this file, Python does not treat the
directory as a package and relative imports from modules (e.g.,
``from .utils.logger import setup_logger``) will fail when running
individual scripts.  The file is intentionally empty.
